# Desktop computer use

vmette can run a **persistent graphical Linux desktop** inside a microVM and
drive it the way a computer-use agent expects: take a screenshot, decide,
move/click/type, screenshot again. This is the opposite of the headless
one-shot path — the VM stays alive across many actions until you explicitly
stop it.

The relief is the same as the rest of vmette: a computer-use agent gets its own
real desktop to click around in that is *not* your machine. The boundary is the
hypervisor, the screen the agent sees and the input it injects stay inside the
guest, and it reaches your host filesystem or network only where you explicitly
grant it.

Each session is also isolated **from every other session**: the desktop rootfs
is mounted read-only on the host and overlaid with a per-session tmpfs in the
guest, so anything a session writes — browser profile and cache, cookies,
downloads, `/etc` edits — lives only in that session and is discarded when it
stops. Two sessions never see each other's state, and nothing persists across a
daemon restart. (Explicit `--share`/share mounts are the deliberate exception:
those are writable and shared with the host because you asked for them.)

There is no Apple graphics window involved. The guest runs a headless X server
(`Xvfb :99`) plus a lightweight window manager (`openbox`), and an in-guest C
agent (`vmette-desktop-agent`) captures the framebuffer with `XGetImage` and
injects input with `XTEST`. The agent speaks a small framed protocol over
**vsock** — the same bidirectional channel vmette already wires up — so no
network and no display server on the host are required.

## Architecture

```
vmette-mcp  desktop_* tools ─┐
vmette CLI  `desktop` subcmd ─┼─ UNIX socket ─▶ vmetted (session registry)
                              │                    │ holds a live vmette::Session per id
                              └────────────────────┘
                                                   ▼ framed vsock round-trip
              guest: Xvfb :99 + openbox + vmette-desktop-agent (XTEST / XGetImage)
```

The host-side primitive is `vmette::Session` with the **Agent** workload
strategy. The one-shot `run()` path is the same primitive with the **OneShot**
strategy; desktop is purely additive and never touches the headless fast path.

Sessions are owned by **vmetted**, not by the client connection that created
them (each connection is one request). A session therefore outlives its creating
connection and is freed only by `desktop_stop`, idle eviction, or daemon
shutdown. The daemon caps concurrent sessions (each is a ~2 GB VM) and evicts
sessions left untouched for longer than the idle TTL (30 min).

## Prerequisites

1. **The daemon must be running.** All desktop access (CLI and MCP) routes
   through `vmetted`:

   ```sh
   vmetted &
   ```

2. **The desktop rootfs image.** You don't have to build anything: vmette pulls
   the published image from `ghcr.io/chamuka-inc/vmette-desktop:latest`
   automatically on first use (the image is public; CI publishes it on every
   release tag). The first `desktop start` extracts it and caches it under
   `~/Library/Caches/vmette/oci/`; later starts are cache hits.

   Building locally is **optional** — it's the path for hacking on the image or
   running offline. `make desktop-image` rebuilds the agent and the chromium
   flags from the current tree and writes the canonical asset, so a *dev* session
   reflects your source rather than the published `:latest`:

   ```sh
  make desktop-image       # build images/vmette-desktop/ → assets/<arch>/vmette-desktop-rootfs.tar
   ```

  The export lands at `assets/<arch>/vmette-desktop-rootfs.tar`, which both clients
   discover the same way they discover `vmlinuz-virt` / `initramfs-vmette`
   (`$VMETTE_ASSETS_DIR`, `./assets`, `<install prefix>/assets`) and which
   **takes precedence** over the registry — no env var, no manual `docker
   export`, no per-call `--image` needed.

   **Resolution order** (client-side, in `vmette` and `vmette-mcp`, mirroring
   how kernel/initramfs are resolved):

   1. explicit `--image REF` (CLI) / `image` arg (MCP) — wins
   2. `$VMETTE_DESKTOP_IMAGE` (any rootfs spec, e.g. a `tar+file://` or OCI ref)
  3. discovered `assets/<arch>/vmette-desktop-rootfs.tar` → `tar+file://…`
   4. `ghcr.io/chamuka-inc/vmette-desktop:latest` — public registry image (the
      zero-setup default when no local asset is present)

   Because resolution is client-side, `$VMETTE_DESKTOP_IMAGE` is read from the
   **client** process (your shell for `vmette desktop start`, the `vmette-mcp`
   server for `desktop_start`) — not the daemon.

   **Docker: needed to *build*, not to *run*.** vmette itself never shells out to
   Docker — its OCI provider is a self-contained registry client, which is why
  tier 4 works out of the box on a machine without Docker. `make desktop-image`
  uses Docker only to *build* the rootfs locally. The default Docker platform
  matches the guest architecture (`linux/arm64` on Apple Silicon,
  `linux/amd64` on Intel), and `--platform` can override it.

   To push the image to a registry instead (a deliberate, separate step):

   ```sh
   bash scripts/build-desktop-image.sh --push           # docker login ghcr.io first
   bash scripts/build-desktop-image.sh --tag my/desktop:dev --export
   ```

   The image bundles `xvfb`, `openbox`, `x11-utils`, base fonts, the compiled
   `vmette-desktop-agent`, and an entrypoint that starts `Xvfb`, the WM (with a
   neutral root colour so an idle desktop isn't pure black), then the agent. It
   also ships `chromium` plus an `/etc/chromium.d/` flags file so a bare
   `chromium <url>` renders under the headless software-GL guest (`--no-sandbox`,
   `--use-gl=swiftshader`, `--disable-dev-shm-usage`, …) — the browser
   incantation lives with the browser, in the image, so `desktop_launch` and the
   CLI stay application-agnostic. Drop the `chromium` install line to shrink the
   image; the agent works without it (you can launch any X app).

## Use it (CLI)

The `vmette desktop` subcommand group is a thin client for manual end-to-end
testing without an MCP host:

```sh
SID=$(vmette desktop start)                  # boots a desktop, prints SESSION_ID
vmette desktop screenshot "$SID" --out shot.png
open shot.png                                # confirm a rendered desktop

vmette desktop exec "$SID" 'xterm &'         # launch an app
vmette desktop screenshot "$SID" --out shot2.png

vmette desktop navigate "$SID" https://example.com   # open a URL (no shell)
vmette desktop exec-capture "$SID" 'cat /etc/os-release'   # run a command, print its output

vmette desktop move  "$SID" 640 400
vmette desktop click "$SID" 640 400
vmette desktop type  "$SID" 'echo hello'
vmette desktop key   "$SID" 'Return'
vmette desktop scroll "$SID" 640 400 down 3
vmette desktop cursor "$SID"                 # prints "X Y"

vmette desktop stop "$SID"                   # tear it down
```

`start` options: `--image REF`, `--size WxH`, `--net`, `--offline`,
`--ca-certs DIR`, `--kernel PATH`, `--initramfs PATH` (kernel/initramfs default to
`assets/<arch>/vmlinuz-virt` and `assets/<arch>/initramfs-vmette` when run from the repo).

`--ca-certs DIR` mounts a host directory of `.crt` / `.pem` enterprise CA
certificates at `/mnt/certs`. At desktop boot the image installs them into
Debian's trust store and writes Chromium's managed `CACertificates` policy, so
browser automation works behind TLS-inspecting proxies without
`--ignore-certificate-errors`.

Global: `--socket PATH` overrides the daemon socket (default
`~/Library/Caches/vmette/vmette.sock`).

## Use it (AI agents via MCP)

`vmette-mcp` exposes the desktop tools to any MCP host. They require `vmetted`
to be running; the MCP server connects to its socket. Override the socket with
`--socket PATH`.

| Tool | Input | Returns |
|------|-------|---------|
| `desktop_start` | `image?`, `size?`, `network?`, `ca_certs?` | session id (text) |
| `desktop_screenshot` | `session_id` | **PNG image content block** |
| `desktop_screenshot_when_settled` | `session_id`, `timeout_ms?` | **PNG image content block** (once the screen stops changing) |
| `desktop_what_changed` | `session_id` | a note describing the changed region since the last capture **plus a PNG image content block** of the fresh frame |
| `desktop_cursor_position` | `session_id` | `"x y"` |
| `desktop_move` | `session_id`, `x`, `y` | status text |
| `desktop_click` | `session_id`, `x`, `y` | status text |
| `desktop_double_click` | `session_id`, `x`, `y` | status text |
| `desktop_right_click` | `session_id`, `x`, `y` | status text |
| `desktop_middle_click` | `session_id`, `x`, `y` | status text |
| `desktop_drag` | `session_id`, `x`, `y` | status text (presses the left button, moves to `(x, y)`, releases — the drag starts at the current pointer position) |
| `desktop_type` | `session_id`, `text` | status text |
| `desktop_key` | `session_id`, `keys` | status text |
| `desktop_get_clipboard` | `session_id` | the clipboard text, exact (empty if unset — click the content to focus it before `ctrl+a`/`ctrl+c`, or the copy grabs nothing) |
| `desktop_set_clipboard` | `session_id`, `text` | status text — owns the `CLIPBOARD` + `PRIMARY` selections |
| `desktop_paste` | `session_id`, `text` | status text — set the clipboard, then Ctrl+V |
| `desktop_scroll` | `session_id`, `x`, `y`, `direction`, `amount` | status text |
| `desktop_exec` | `session_id`, `command` | status text (fire-and-forget) |
| `desktop_exec_capture` | `session_id`, `command`, `timeout_ms?` | the command's combined stdout/stderr + exit code (runs to completion) |
| `desktop_navigate` | `session_id`, `url` | status text — opens `url` in the browser with no shell and no synthetic keystrokes |
| `desktop_launch` | `session_id`, `command`, `wait_ms?` | **PNG image content block** (the app's first painted frame) |
| `desktop_stop` | `session_id` | status text |

`desktop_screenshot` returns an MCP image content block
(`image/png`), which is what makes the loop consumable by a computer-use agent.
`desktop_click` / `desktop_double_click` / `desktop_right_click` move the
pointer to `(x, y)` first, then click (agent click actions fire at the current
pointer position). `network=true` on `desktop_start` is subject to the server's
`--allow-network` gate.

**Starting an app and seeing it: `desktop_launch`.** `desktop_exec` is
fire-and-forget — it launches a command and returns immediately, leaving you to
poll for the window. `desktop_launch` is the one-call alternative: it
backgrounds the command (redirecting its stdio to a guest log so a chatty app
can't block before painting), waits for the screen to actually change and then
settle, and returns that frame. It is **application-agnostic** — it knows
nothing about browsers. You pass a complete command and supply whatever flags
the app needs; e.g. `command: "chromium https://example.com"`,
`"gimp /mnt/a.png"`, or `"xterm"`. The app-specific incantation a headless
software-rendered guest requires (for the browser: `--no-sandbox`, software GL)
lives in the **desktop image**, not in this tool — see below — so a bare
`chromium <url>` renders. Network-dependent apps only reach the network when the
session was started with `network=true`.

**Navigating a browser: `desktop_navigate`.** Rather than focusing the address
bar and typing (which races omnibox autocomplete and focus), `desktop_navigate`
hands the URL straight to the browser's launcher with **no shell and no
synthetic keystrokes**, so the URL is never word-split or interpreted. It is
fire-and-forget — it returns once navigation starts, so follow it with
`desktop_screenshot_when_settled` to wait for the page to paint. The desktop
image ships a browser-agnostic `vmette-open` launcher, so a custom image can
swap browsers without touching the agent.

**Reading a command's output: `desktop_exec_capture`.** Unlike the
fire-and-forget `desktop_exec`, this runs a short command to completion and
returns its combined stdout/stderr plus exit code — for reading a file or
probing state inside a desktop session without OCR'ing a screenshot. The
in-guest agent is single-threaded, so it blocks other desktop actions until the
command returns or hits its (bounded) timeout; keep it to short, terminating
commands and use `desktop_exec` / `desktop_launch` to start GUI apps.

## Protocol

### Daemon (UNIX socket, line-delimited JSON)

One request object per connection; one reply object back.

```jsonc
// → boot a session
{ "kind": "desktop_start",
  "kernel": "/abs/vmlinuz-virt", "initramfs": "/abs/initramfs-vmette",
  "image": "tar+file:///abs/assets/aarch64/vmette-desktop-rootfs.tar", // required; client-resolved
  "size": "1280x800",                                          // optional
  "net": false, "offline": false,
  "shares": [{"tag":"certs", "path":"/abs/company-cas"}] } // optional
// ← { "kind": "session", "session_id": "a1b2c3..." }

// → one action
{ "kind": "desktop_action", "session_id": "a1b2c3...",
  "action": { "action": "left_click" } }
// ← { "kind": "action_result", "ok": true }
//   screenshots add "png_base64"; cursor_position adds "x"/"y";
//   failures set "ok": false and "error".

// → stop
{ "kind": "desktop_stop", "session_id": "a1b2c3..." }
// ← { "kind": "stopped" }
```

Errors come back as `{ "kind": "error", "message": "..." }`.

### Guest (framed vsock)

Between the host `Session` and the in-guest agent the wire format is binary:

```text
[u32 LE header_len][header JSON][optional binary payload]
```

The request header is an `Action`; the response header is a `ResponseHeader`
(`ok`, `error?`, `x?`, `y?`, `payload_len`). Screenshots travel as a raw PNG
payload after the header. See `crates/vmette/src/desktop.rs`.

## Action reference

Actions mirror the Anthropic computer-use tool so the MCP layer maps 1:1.
JSON shape is `{"action": "<name>", ...fields}`.

| Action | Fields | Effect |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `screenshot` | — | Capture framebuffer → PNG payload. The mouse pointer is composited in (via XFixes), so the cursor shows in screenshots and the live view. |
| `cursor_position` | — | Report pointer `(x, y)` in the header. |
| `mouse_move` | `x`, `y` | Absolute pointer move. |
| `left_click` | — | Left click at current position. |
| `right_click` | — | Right click at current position. |
| `middle_click` | — | Middle click at current position. |
| `double_click` | — | Double left click at current position. |
| `left_click_drag` | `x`, `y` | Press, move to `(x, y)`, release. |
| `type` | `text` | Type a UTF-8 string via synthetic key events. |
| `key` | `keys` | Press a chord, e.g. `"ctrl+c"`, `"Return"`, `"alt+Tab"`. |
| `scroll` | `x`, `y`, `direction`, `amount` | Scroll `amount` clicks (`up`/`down`/`left`/`right`). |
| `set_clipboard` | `text` | Own the `CLIPBOARD` + `PRIMARY` selections with `text`. |
| `get_clipboard` | — | Read clipboard text; returned as the response payload (UTF-8). |
| `wait` | `ms` | Sleep guest-side to let the UI settle. |
| `exec` | `command` | Launch a shell command (e.g. `"chromium &"`). |

## Live view (watch / drive the desktop)

A running session can be watched — and optionally driven — by a human over
**VNC**, without changing the guest. `desktop_view` asks the daemon to start a
live view and returns a loopback address:

```text
desktop_view { "session_id": "…" }  →  vnc://127.0.0.1:5901
```

Open it with any VNC client — on macOS, `open vnc://127.0.0.1:5901` launches
Screen Sharing; [TigerVNC](https://tigervnc.org/) and other standard viewers
work too.

How it works: the daemon runs a small RFB (VNC) server that reuses the
session's existing capabilities — it captures the screen with the `screenshot`
action and translates the viewer's mouse/keyboard into the same computer-use
actions the agent uses (`mouse_move`, `left_click`, `left_click_drag`,
`scroll`, `type`, `key`, …). So a human and the agent drive the *same* display,
taking turns through the session's request lock (a screenshot never interleaves
with synthetic input). No x11vnc in the guest, no second vsock port — it is a
translation layer in the daemon (`crates/vmette-daemon/src/{rfb,view}.rs`).

Properties:

- **Per-session, per-port.** Each session's view binds its own ephemeral
  loopback port, so several desktops can be watched at once with no collision.
  `desktop_view` is idempotent — repeated calls return the same address.
- **Loopback only.** The listener binds `127.0.0.1`; the view is reachable only
  from the host. It offers **VNC Authentication** (macOS Screen Sharing refuses
  plain `None`), but the challenge response is **not verified** — type any
  password to connect. The access boundary is the loopback bind + the ephemeral
  per-session port, not the password.
- **Pull-based, ~5 fps.** The server sends changed tiles in response to the
  client's update requests (reusing the same tile-diff idea as the settle
  detector). Plenty for watching an agent act in discrete steps; not a video
  feed.
- **Lifecycle.** The view is torn down with the session (`desktop_stop`, idle
  eviction, or daemon shutdown).

## Constraints

- **Software-rendered Xvfb, no GPU.** Fine for agentic GUI control and UI
  testing; not for video / WebGL / 3D.
- **Slower boot than headless** — several seconds for the desktop image + Xvfb
  + WM + first app, versus ~1 s for a headless one-shot.
- **Memory:** each session is a live VM holding a browser; budget 1–2 GB RAM
  and ≥2 vCPUs per session. The daemon caps concurrent sessions.
- **Idle eviction:** sessions untouched for 30 minutes are force-stopped.
- **Arch:** the desktop image and agent must match vmette's guest assets
  (`aarch64` on Apple Silicon, `x86_64` on Intel).
- **Live view is loopback-only and ~5 fps** (see [Live view](#live-view-watch--drive-the-desktop)):
  enough to watch and drive the agent, not a video feed.
