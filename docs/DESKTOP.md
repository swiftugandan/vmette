# Desktop computer use

vmette can run a **persistent graphical Linux desktop** inside a microVM and
drive it the way a computer-use agent expects: take a screenshot, decide,
move/click/type, screenshot again. This is the opposite of the headless
one-shot path — the VM stays alive across many actions until you explicitly
stop it.

A computer-use agent gets its own real desktop that is *not* your machine: the
desktop rootfs is mounted read-only and overlaid with a per-session tmpfs in the
guest, so everything a session writes is discarded when it stops. The boundary is
the hypervisor. The CLI and MCP expose no `--share` for desktop sessions; the
only host grant they wire in is the read-only `--ca-certs` mount (with a
machine-wide fallback, also read-only).

There is no Apple graphics window involved. The guest runs a headless X server
(`Xvfb :99`) plus a lightweight window manager (`openbox`), and a C agent
(`vmette-desktop-agent`) captures the framebuffer with `XGetImage` and injects
input with `XTEST`. The agent speaks a small framed protocol over **vsock** —
the same bidirectional channel vmette already wires up — so no network and no
display server on the host are required.

The agent itself is supplied by **vmette**, not baked into the rootfs, so the
desktop runs on any image with an X server + a window manager — see
[Bring your own desktop rootfs](#bring-your-own-desktop-rootfs).

## Architecture

```
vmette-mcp  desktop_* tools ─┐
vmette CLI  `desktop` subcmd ─┼─ UNIX socket ─▶ vmetted (session registry)
                              │                    │ holds a live vmette::Session per id
                              └────────────────────┘
                                                   ▼ framed vsock round-trip
              guest: Xvfb :99 + openbox + vmette-desktop-agent (XTEST / XGetImage)
```

The host-side primitive is `vmette::Session` with the **Agent** workload
strategy. The one-shot `run()` path is the same primitive with the **OneShot**
strategy; desktop is purely additive and never touches the headless fast path.

Sessions are owned by **vmetted**, not by the client connection that created
them (each connection is one request). A session therefore outlives its creating
connection and is freed only by `desktop_stop`, idle eviction, or daemon
shutdown. The daemon caps concurrent sessions (each is a live VM — see
[Constraints](#constraints) for the default size) and evicts sessions left
untouched for longer than the idle TTL (30 min).

## Prerequisites

1. **The daemon.** All desktop access (CLI and MCP) routes through `vmetted`,
   but you don't normally start it yourself: both clients auto-spawn it on
   first desktop access (the CLI on the default socket, the MCP server always).
   Run it manually only when you point `--socket` at a daemon you manage
   yourself:

   ```sh
   vmetted &
   ```

2. **A desktop rootfs.** You don't have to build anything: with no `--image`,
   vmette pulls the published default `ghcr.io/chamuka-inc/vmette-desktop:latest`
   automatically on first use (the image is public). The first `desktop start`
   extracts it and caches it under `~/Library/Caches/vmette/oci/`; later starts
   are cache hits. That image is a convenience default (Xvfb + openbox + chromium
   + fonts); the usual path is to bring your own GUI image rather than rebuild
   ours, see [Bring your own desktop rootfs](#bring-your-own-desktop-rootfs).

   **Resolution order** (client-side, in `vmette` and `vmette-mcp`, mirroring how
   kernel/initramfs are resolved):

   1. explicit `--image REF` (CLI) / `image` arg (MCP) — wins
   2. `$VMETTE_DESKTOP_IMAGE` (any rootfs spec, e.g. a `tar+file://` or OCI ref) —
      read from the **client** process (your shell for `vmette desktop start`, the
      `vmette-mcp` server for `desktop_start`), not the daemon
   3. a locally-provided `assets/<arch>/vmette-desktop-rootfs.tar` (e.g. a
      `docker export` of your own GUI image) → `tar+file://…`
   4. `ghcr.io/chamuka-inc/vmette-desktop:latest` — the published default when no
      local asset is present

   **No Docker needed to run.** vmette never shells out to Docker — its OCI
   provider is a self-contained registry client, so the published default works
   out of the box on a machine without Docker. Building or customizing that image
   (Docker required) is covered in
   [Bring your own desktop rootfs](#bring-your-own-desktop-rootfs).

## Bring your own desktop rootfs

Because the agent is host-injected (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) #2), the
entire contract a desktop rootfs must satisfy is an **X server (`Xvfb`)** and a
**window manager**. So you can point `--image` at a stock `debian + xvfb +
openbox` image, your own GUI image, or an OCI ref rather than rebuild the bundled
`vmette-desktop` image:

```sh
vmette desktop start --image tar+file:///path/to/my-gui-rootfs.tar
vmette desktop start --image my-registry/my-desktop:latest
```

How it works:

- vmette builds a **per-arch, fully-static** `vmette-desktop-agent` (musl + a
  from-source X client stack — `scripts/build-desktop-agent-static.sh`) into
  `assets/<arch>/desktop-agent/`, beside a self-contained
  `vmette-desktop-run.sh` startup. Being fully static, **one** agent binary runs
  in any rootfs regardless of its libc (glibc or musl) — it carries its own libc
  and X clients and needs nothing from the rootfs but the X server socket.

  ```sh
  bash scripts/build-desktop-agent-static.sh   # → assets/<arch>/desktop-agent/
  ```

- `vmetted` discovers that directory (`vmette_assets::resolve_agent_share`) and
  mounts it into Agent-workload guests as the **read-only** `agent` virtio-fs
  share. The guest's PID-1 init runs the injected `/mnt/agent/vmette-desktop-run.sh`,
  which brings up `Xvfb` + a window manager (auto-detected: openbox / fluxbox /
  icewm / …) and execs the static agent. The share is read-only so a guest can't
  write back into vmette's host-side agent directory.

- **Fallback / compatibility.** When the agent asset isn't present, the init
  falls back to an agent baked into the rootfs at
  `/usr/local/bin/vmette-desktop-entrypoint.sh` — which is what the bundled
  `vmette-desktop` image ships, so it keeps working unchanged. When the asset
  *is* present, the injected agent is used for every session (so a single,
  host-version-matched agent runs everywhere).

A minimal bring-your-own image needs only:

```dockerfile
FROM debian:stable-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends xvfb openbox \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
# add your apps (a browser, an editor, …); no vmette agent required.
```

The agent injects a host CA-cert policy for Chromium when `--ca-certs` is in
play (best-effort), but otherwise makes no assumptions about the rootfs's apps.

## Use it (CLI)

The `vmette desktop` subcommand group is a thin client for manual end-to-end
testing without an MCP host:

```sh
SID=$(vmette desktop start)                  # boots a desktop, prints SESSION_ID
vmette desktop screenshot "$SID" --out shot.png
open shot.png                                # confirm a rendered desktop

vmette desktop exec "$SID" 'xterm &'         # launch an app
vmette desktop screenshot "$SID" --out shot2.png --settle  # wait for the screen to quiesce first

vmette desktop navigate "$SID" https://example.com   # open a URL (no shell)
vmette desktop exec-capture "$SID" 'cat /etc/os-release'   # run a command, print its output

vmette desktop move  "$SID" 640 400
vmette desktop click "$SID" 640 400
vmette desktop drag  "$SID" 200 200 600 400  # press at (200,200), drag to (600,400)
vmette desktop type  "$SID" 'echo hello'
vmette desktop key   "$SID" 'Return'
vmette desktop scroll "$SID" 640 400 down 3
vmette desktop cursor "$SID"                 # prints "X Y"

vmette desktop set-clipboard "$SID" 'hello'  # own CLIPBOARD + PRIMARY
vmette desktop get-clipboard "$SID"          # print the clipboard text
vmette desktop paste "$SID" 'hello'          # set clipboard, then Ctrl+V
vmette desktop view "$SID"                    # start a VNC live view, prints vnc://…

vmette desktop stop "$SID"                   # tear it down
```

`start` options: `--image REF`, `--size WxH`, `--net`, `--offline`,
`--ca-certs DIR`, `--kernel PATH`, `--initramfs PATH` (kernel/initramfs are
auto-discovered via `vmette_assets::require_asset` — searching `$VMETTE_ASSETS_DIR`,
`./assets/<arch>`, then the install prefix — when not given).

`screenshot` options: `--out FILE` (required), and `--settle` to wait until the
screen stops changing before capturing — tunable with `--timeout-ms N` (give up
after N ms; default 10000) and `--stable-hold-ms N` (how long the screen must
hold still). Either tuning flag implies `--settle`.

`--ca-certs DIR` mounts a host directory of `.crt` / `.pem` / `.cer` enterprise CA
certificates at `/mnt/certs`. At desktop boot the guest installs them into the
system trust store (generically, in the initramfs init) and the desktop startup
(the injected `vmette-desktop-run.sh`, and the bundled image's entrypoint)
additionally writes Chromium's managed `CACertificates` policy, so browser
automation works behind TLS-inspecting proxies without
`--ignore-certificate-errors`. When `--ca-certs` is omitted it falls back to the
machine-wide source (`$VMETTE_CA_CERTS`, else `~/.config/vmette/certs`) — the
same certificates every other vmette root trusts (see
[HACKING.md](HACKING.md#trusting-a-host-ca-in-every-guest)). On macOS,
`scripts/export-macos-ca-certs.sh` stages the keychain roots there in one step.

Global: `--socket PATH` overrides the daemon socket (default
`~/Library/Caches/vmette/vmette.sock`).

## Use it (AI agents via MCP)

`vmette-mcp` exposes the desktop tools to any MCP host. They route through
`vmetted`, which the MCP server auto-spawns on first desktop access (override the
socket with `--socket PATH`).

| Tool | Input | Returns |
|------|-------|---------|
| `desktop_start` | `image?`, `size?`, `network?`, `ca_certs?` | session id (text) |
| `desktop_view` | `session_id` | `vnc://host:port` loopback address for a VNC client (see [Live view](#live-view-watch--drive-the-desktop)) |
| `desktop_screenshot` | `session_id` | a **framebuffer note** (`framebuffer WxH; …`) **plus a PNG image content block** |
| `desktop_screenshot_when_settled` | `session_id`, `timeout_ms?` (default 10000) | note + framebuffer note + **PNG image content block** (once the screen stops changing) |
| `desktop_what_changed` | `session_id` | a note describing the changed region since the last capture + framebuffer note **plus a PNG image content block** of the changed region — a crop, so the framebuffer note reflects the crop's pixel size, not the display size (the full frame is returned only when nothing changed) |
| `desktop_cursor_position` | `session_id` | `"x y"` |
| `desktop_move` | `session_id`, `x`, `y` | status text (echoes where the pointer landed; flags `(constrained)`) |
| `desktop_click` | `session_id`, `x`, `y` | status text (echoes the click position) |
| `desktop_double_click` | `session_id`, `x`, `y` | status text (echoes the click position) |
| `desktop_right_click` | `session_id`, `x`, `y` | status text (echoes the click position) |
| `desktop_middle_click` | `session_id`, `x`, `y` | status text (echoes the click position) |
| `desktop_drag` | `session_id`, `x`, `y` | status text (presses the left button, moves to `(x, y)`, releases — the drag starts at the **current** pointer position, so precede it with `desktop_move` to set the origin; contrast the CLI's all-in-one `drag FX FY TX TY`) |
| `desktop_type` | `session_id`, `text` | status text |
| `desktop_key` | `session_id`, `keys` | status text |
| `desktop_get_clipboard` | `session_id` | the clipboard text, exact (empty if unset — click the content to focus it before `ctrl+a`/`ctrl+c`, or the copy grabs nothing) |
| `desktop_set_clipboard` | `session_id`, `text` | status text — owns the `CLIPBOARD` + `PRIMARY` selections |
| `desktop_paste` | `session_id`, `text` | status text — set the clipboard, then Ctrl+V |
| `desktop_scroll` | `session_id`, `x`, `y`, `direction`, `amount` | status text |
| `desktop_exec` | `session_id`, `command` | status text (fire-and-forget) |
| `desktop_exec_capture` | `session_id`, `command`, `timeout_ms?` | the command's combined stdout/stderr + exit code (runs to completion) |
| `desktop_navigate` | `session_id`, `url` | status text — opens `url` (a URL or a local file path) in the browser with no shell and no synthetic keystrokes |
| `desktop_launch` | `session_id`, `command`, `wait_ms?` | status note + framebuffer note + **PNG image content block** (the app's first settled frame) |
| `desktop_stop` | `session_id` | status text |

`desktop_screenshot` returns an MCP image content block
(`image/png`), which is what makes the loop consumable by a computer-use agent.
Alongside the image it returns a **framebuffer note** (`framebuffer WxH; …
origin top-left`): pointer/click coordinates are in that exact pixel space, so an
agent reasoning over a downscaled rendering can map its target back to true
coordinates instead of guessing the scale. `desktop_click` /
`desktop_double_click` / `desktop_right_click` / `desktop_middle_click` move the
pointer to `(x, y)` first, then click (agent click actions fire at the current
pointer position).
`desktop_move` and the click tools **echo where the pointer actually landed**
in their status text — if a window manager constrained the move, the reply reads
`… landed at X Y (constrained)`, so a missed target is observable in one
round-trip instead of requiring a follow-up screenshot. `desktop_scroll` returns
a fixed `scrolled` and `desktop_drag` a fixed `dragged to X Y` (the requested
target), neither echoing the landed position.
`network=true` on `desktop_start` is subject to the server's `--allow-network`
gate.

**`desktop_launch`** is the one-call alternative to the fire-and-forget
`desktop_exec`: it backgrounds the command (redirecting its stdio to a guest log
so a chatty app can't block before painting), waits for the screen to change and
settle, and returns that frame. It is **application-agnostic** — you pass a
complete command and any flags the app needs (`"chromium https://example.com"`,
`"gimp /mnt/a.png"`, `"xterm"`); the headless-guest incantation (for the
browser: `--no-sandbox`, software GL) lives in the **desktop image**, not the
tool, so a bare `chromium <url>` renders.

**`desktop_navigate`** is fire-and-forget — it returns once navigation *starts*,
so follow it with `desktop_screenshot_when_settled` to wait for the page to
paint.

**`desktop_exec_capture`** runs the command to completion; the session serializes
desktop actions, so a long capture delays the next request until it returns or
hits its timeout. Keep it to short, terminating commands and use `desktop_exec` /
`desktop_launch` for GUI apps.

## Protocol

### Daemon (UNIX socket, line-delimited JSON)

One request object per connection; one reply object back.

```jsonc
// → boot a session
{ "kind": "desktop_start",
  "kernel": "/abs/vmlinuz-virt", "initramfs": "/abs/initramfs-vmette",
  "image": "tar+file:///abs/assets/aarch64/vmette-desktop-rootfs.tar", // required; client-resolved
  "size": "1280x800",                                          // optional
  "net": false, "offline": false,
  "vcpus": 2, "mem_mib": 2048,                                  // optional; omitted by both clients (CLI and MCP) → daemon defaults (2 vCPU / 2048 MiB)
  "shares": [{"tag":"certs", "path":"/abs/company-cas"}] } // optional (example is non-exhaustive)
// ← { "kind": "session", "session_id": "a1b2c3..." }

// → one action
{ "kind": "desktop_action", "session_id": "a1b2c3...",
  "action": { "action": "left_click" } }
// ← { "kind": "action_result", "ok": true, "x": 200, "y": 200 }
//   screenshots add "png_base64"; cursor_position AND the pointer actions
//   (move/click/scroll/drag) add "x"/"y" — the resulting pointer position;
//   failures set "ok": false and "error".

// → stop
{ "kind": "desktop_stop", "session_id": "a1b2c3..." }
// ← { "kind": "stopped" }
```

Errors come back as `{ "kind": "error", "message": "..." }`.

### Guest (framed vsock)

Between the host `Session` and the in-guest agent the wire format is binary:

```text
[u32 LE req_id][u32 LE header_len][header JSON][optional binary payload]
```

The host assigns a monotonically increasing `req_id` per request that the guest
echoes verbatim in the matching response frame, so the host demultiplexes
responses back to the right waiting caller. The request header is an `Action`;
the response header is a `ResponseHeader`
(`ok`, `error?`, `x?`, `y?`, `payload_len`). `x`/`y` carry the pointer position:
`cursor_position` reports it, and every pointer action echoes the *resulting*
position. Screenshots travel as a raw PNG payload after the header (its pixel
dimensions are the coordinate space for all pointer actions). See
`crates/vmette/src/desktop.rs`.

## Action reference

Actions mirror the Anthropic computer-use tool so the MCP layer maps 1:1.
JSON shape is `{"action": "<name>", ...fields}`. This is the raw vsock Action
vocabulary — a superset of what the CLI and MCP expose, so a row here (e.g.
`wait`) need not have a matching `desktop` subcommand or `desktop_*` tool.

| Action | Fields | Effect |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `screenshot` | — | Capture framebuffer → PNG payload. The PNG's pixel size is the coordinate space for all pointer actions. The mouse pointer is composited in (via XFixes), so the cursor shows in screenshots and the live view. |
| `cursor_position` | — | Report pointer `(x, y)` in the header. |
| `mouse_move` | `x`, `y` | Absolute pointer move. Header echoes the resulting `(x, y)`. |
| `left_click` | — | Left click at current position. Header echoes the click `(x, y)`. |
| `right_click` | — | Right click at current position. Header echoes the click `(x, y)`. |
| `middle_click` | — | Middle click at current position. Header echoes the click `(x, y)`. |
| `double_click` | — | Double left click at current position. Header echoes the click `(x, y)`. |
| `left_click_drag` | `x`, `y` | Press, drag to `(x, y)` with **interpolated motion** (so drag-and-drop targets recognize the gesture), release. Header echoes the resulting `(x, y)`. |
| `type` | `text` | Type a UTF-8 string via synthetic key events. |
| `key` | `keys` | Press a chord, e.g. `"ctrl+c"`, `"Return"`, `"alt+Tab"`. |
| `scroll` | `x`, `y`, `direction`, `amount` | Scroll `amount` clicks (`up`/`down`/`left`/`right`) at `(x, y)`. Header echoes the resulting `(x, y)`. |
| `set_clipboard` | `text` | Own the `CLIPBOARD` + `PRIMARY` selections with `text`. |
| `get_clipboard` | — | Read clipboard text; returned as the response payload (UTF-8). |
| `wait` | `ms` | Sleep guest-side to let the UI settle. |
| `exec` | `command` | Launch a shell command (e.g. `"chromium &"`); fire-and-forget. |
| `exec_capture` | `command`, `timeout_ms?` | Run `command` (via `/bin/sh -c`) to completion **synchronously**; returns combined stdout/stderr as the payload (UTF-8) and the exit status in the header's `exit_code` (absent ⇒ killed by the timeout guard or a signal). Blocks every other action until it returns. |
| `navigate` | `url` | Hand `url` to the browser's `vmette-open` launcher with **no shell** (never word-split or interpreted). Fire-and-forget: returns once the launcher spawns, not when the page loads. |

## Live view (watch / drive the desktop)

A running session can be watched — and optionally driven — by a human over
**VNC**, without changing the guest. `desktop_view` asks the daemon to start a
live view and returns a loopback address:

```text
desktop_view { "session_id": "…" }  →  vnc://127.0.0.1:<ephemeral>
```

The port is an ephemeral loopback port assigned per session (`5901` here is
illustrative). Open the returned address with any VNC client — on macOS,
`open vnc://127.0.0.1:5901` launches
Screen Sharing; [TigerVNC](https://tigervnc.org/) and other standard viewers
work too.

How it works: the daemon runs a small RFB (VNC) server that reuses the
session's existing capabilities — it captures the screen with the `screenshot`
action and translates the viewer's mouse/keyboard into the same computer-use
actions the agent uses (`mouse_move`, `left_click`, `left_click_drag`,
`scroll`, `type`, `key`, …). So a human and the agent drive the *same* display,
taking turns through the session's request lock (a screenshot never interleaves
with synthetic input). No x11vnc in the guest, no second vsock port — it is a
translation layer in the daemon (`crates/vmette-daemon/src/{rfb,view}.rs`).

Properties:

- **Per-session, per-port.** Each session's view binds its own ephemeral
  loopback port, so several desktops can be watched at once with no collision.
  `desktop_view` is idempotent — repeated calls return the same address.
- **Loopback only.** The listener binds `127.0.0.1`; the view is reachable only
  from the host. It offers **VNC Authentication** (macOS Screen Sharing refuses
  plain `None`), but the challenge response is **not verified** — type any
  password to connect. The access boundary is the loopback bind + the ephemeral
  per-session port, not the password.
- **Pull-based, ~5 fps.** The server sends changed tiles in response to the
  client's update requests (reusing the same tile-diff idea as the settle
  detector). Plenty for watching an agent act in discrete steps; not a video
  feed.
- **Lifecycle.** The view is torn down with the session (`desktop_stop`, idle
  eviction, or daemon shutdown).

## Constraints

- **Software-rendered Xvfb, no GPU.** Fine for agentic GUI control and UI
  testing; not for video / WebGL / 3D.
- **Slower boot than headless** — several seconds for the desktop image + Xvfb
  + WM + first app, versus ~1 s for a headless one-shot.
- **Memory:** each session is a live GUI VM — **2 GB RAM (2048 MiB) and 2
  vCPUs** by default. The daemon caps concurrent sessions.
- **Arch:** the desktop image and agent must match vmette's guest assets
  (`aarch64` on Apple Silicon, `x86_64` on Intel).
