//! Tile-based **pixel-settle detection** for the desktop perception layer.
//!
//! An agent drives the Agent-workload desktop purely through screenshots
//! (`vmette::Action::Screenshot`). After it acts, we want to hand it the screen
//! once it has *settled* (stopped changing) — but a playing video or a blinking
//! caret means the framebuffer never globally quiesces, so a naive "is this
//! frame identical to the last?" check either fires too early or never fires.
//! This module decides settle from the pixels alone and, crucially, reports the
//! regions that are *still* moving so the model can reason about them instead of
//! being blocked by them.
//!
//! This is the daemon's perception logic: its only consumer is the session
//! registry (poll the agent, decode each PNG, feed it here, stop when settled).
//! It is **pure** — no VZ, no objc2, no I/O — plain pixel math over decoded
//! frames, unit-testable against synthetic sequences. The pixel-rectangle type
//! it reports ([`Rect`]) is the shared wire type from `vmette-proto`.
//!
//! ## Design (distilled from prior art)
//!
//! * **x11vnc** finds change at **32×32 tile** granularity and throttles only
//!   when few tiles move, so a small animating region never marks the whole
//!   screen busy. We adopt the tile grid and per-tile change tracking.
//! * **TurboVNC** hands over a region once it has been *still for a timeout* —
//!   region-local settling, not whole-frame. We track per-tile stable-run
//!   length and settle each tile independently.
//! * **Playwright** declares stability after **N consecutive unchanged frames**,
//!   and **pixelmatch** tolerates antialiasing/cursor noise rather than
//!   demanding exact equality. We use a per-pixel delta threshold plus a
//!   per-tile changed-pixel tolerance so a blinking caret can't livelock us.
//! * **Visual-regression** tools mask persistently-changing regions. We derive
//!   that mask automatically: tiles that keep changing across a sliding window
//!   are classified as *churning*, excluded from the settle test, and reported
//!   back as "still moving here" rectangles (the agent's video/animation hint).
