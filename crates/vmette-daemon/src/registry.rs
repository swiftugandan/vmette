//! Desktop session registry — the daemon's **stateful** subsystem.
//!
//! This is deliberately separate from the stateless per-request dispatch in
//! `main.rs` (which forks a `vmette` subprocess and forgets about it). Here we
//! hold *live* [`vmette::Session`] VMs in-process so a desktop persists across
//! many client requests: a single VM boots Xvfb + a WM + the computer-use
//! agent once, then services screenshot/click/type round-trips until it is
//! explicitly stopped.
//!
//! ## Threading
//!
//! A [`vmette::Session`] is `!Send` — it owns objc2 `Retained` handles and
//! drives its VM on a private dispatch queue. So each session gets its own
//! dedicated OS thread that:
//!   1. boots the `Session`,
//!   2. hands the daemon the `Send` [`SessionClient`] + [`StopHandle`],
//!   3. blocks in `Session::wait()` until the VM ends, then drops the
//!      `Session` (tearing the VM down).
//!
//! The registry itself only ever stores the `Send` handles + the thread's
//! `JoinHandle`, so it lives happily inside the multi-threaded tokio runtime.
//! All VM-control hops off the async threads: blocking `request`/`stop`/`join`
//! calls go through `spawn_blocking`.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle guardrails
//!
//! - **max-live cap**: each session is a ~2 GB VM, so [`start`] refuses past
//!   [`Registry::max_sessions`].
//! - **idle eviction**: [`sweep_idle`] force-stops sessions untouched for
//!   longer than the idle TTL (run periodically by a background task).
//! - **shutdown**: [`stop_all`] tears every session down on daemon exit.
//!
//! Sessions are owned by the registry, not by any one client connection
//! (connections are one-request-each), so a session outlives the connection
//! that created it and is freed only by `desktop_stop`, idle eviction, or
//! daemon shutdown.
